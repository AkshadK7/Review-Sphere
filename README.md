## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Automatically detect and classify reviews as positive or negative using a threshold-based sentiment model.
- **Tag Extraction**  
  Extract the most common tags from user reviews using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- **Review Clustering**  
  Group similar reviews using K-Means clustering, enabling better insights into customer opinions.
- **Recommendation Engine**  
  Suggest products to users based on their review history and preferences.
- **Data Visualization**
  - View common tags in a horizontal stack and a pie chart.
  - Explore overall sentiment in bar and pie charts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Add, view, and manage reviews through an interactive UI.
  - See scrollable lists of reviews sorted by timestamps.

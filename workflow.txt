Frontend :

1. dropdown component to select a product
2. add your review component (textbox, submit button, clear button)
3. most common tags component (show tags stacked horizontally)
4. most common tags pie chart
5. overall sentiments graph (as on amazon)
6. overall sentiments pie chart
7. all comments component (sorted by timestamp desc, scrollable)
8. show similar products or customers also bought this


Backend :

1. we'll need a simple database to store all this information so that it is persisted. You can pick sqlite or duckdb or something that will easily go with python and fastapi
2. create APIs using FastAPI for the CRUD operations and integrate it with streamlit and db
3. create a sentiment analysis model with some thresholds and define some base sentiments.
4. integrate the sentiment analysis model with the APIs
5. create a named entity recognition based NLP model for generating most common tags and generate clusters of the stored review comments according to that
6. integrate the NLP model with the APIs
7. create a recommender system model which suggests a user some more products according to his history.
8. integrate the recommender model with the APIs


DB :

1. Create a Database called Store
2. Create Tables called Product, User, and maybe Comments (if required), and anything else according to you
3. Set up datatypes according to you and integrate to backend
